# Codeur en Seine 2023 - Demo Project

## Project Description

This project is a demo created explicitly for the talk "Spring boot vs Quarkus: Who will reign in 2023," presented at the conference 'Codeur en Seine 2023'. The talk focuses on comparing the two popular Java frameworks - Spring Boot and Quarkus.

The project consists of two applications:

1. A Spring Boot application
2. A Quarkus application

Both applications offer a unique service that generates kid stories based on dinosaurs and members of the Paw Patrol.

Here's the link to the slides of the talk: [Spring boot vs Quarkus: Who will reign in 2023?](https://www.slideshare.net/LocMagnette/quarkus-vs-spring-boot-quel-est-le-framework-qui-rgnera-en-matre-en-2023)

## Features

The demo allows us to witness the potential and capabilities of both Spring Boot and Quarkus, thereby creating a platform to evaluate which among them may lead the Java world in 2023.

## Setup and Installation

To get either of the projects up and running on your local machine, please follow these instructions:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate into the project directory (either Spring Boot or Quarkus based on your preference).
3. Install the dependencies using the suitable dependency management tool (Maven or Gradle).
4. Once dependencies are installed, run the application. For Spring Boot project, use `mvn spring-boot:run` and for Quarkus project, use `./mvnw quarkus:dev`.

We don't actively seek contributions as this was specifically designed for the talk. However, insights and discussions are welcomed!

## License

Both the Spring Boot and Quarkus demo projects are licensed under the MIT License.

## Conclusion

We hope these demos serve their purpose of showcasing the potential of Spring Boot and Quarkus. This should aid in gaining an understanding to draw a conclusion on the question - "Spring boot vs Quarkus: Who will reign in 2023?".
